# Simple-Calculator
"I would like to introduce our online calculator as your go-to resource for precise and quick mathematical answers."
I made this calculator using just  web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator can perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The calculator consists of the following components:

Mathematical Operators: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).

Digits and Decimal Button: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, . .

Display Screen: It displays the mathematical expression and the result.

Clear Screen Button: It clears all mathematical values.

Calculate button (=): It evaluates the mathematical expression and returns the result.
